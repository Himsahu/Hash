                                    <p>Biking by no means is a solo activity. It is indeed an intoxicating experience and the pleasure it gives increases as we join a group or more people. Group rides are the latest trends and have been quite the attraction all together. Competing with one another, conversing all the way along, witnessing transitions becomes blissful when we have somebody along. We at Hashtag Planners organise some thrilling and adventure filled biking events. Come with your friends or register with complete strangers, you will leave as friends by the end of it. Starting from designing an enticing itenary, accomodations, border permissions, refreshments to a comfortable and sufficient equipment we arrange for everything to extend a hassle free ride. All you have to do is signup, get your bikes ready, and you are all set to go and explore the wilderness and exquisite sides of the world.  </p>
